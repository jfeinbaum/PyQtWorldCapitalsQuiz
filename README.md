# World Capitals Quiz
## created by Jake Feinbaum
  
A quiz to name all the world capitals, built with PyQt5 and Sqlite3.

Instructions:
  1. Download and `cd` into this repository.
  2. Run `python3 wcg.py` to start the quiz. If this is your first time using the application, a database `data.db` will be created with elapsed times set to 0 for each country.
  3. Guess the capitals until the entire table is filled. You can skip countries or give up to end the game early.
  4. To recreate the database, run `python3 init_db.py`.
